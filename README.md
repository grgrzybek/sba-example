# Spring Boot Admin Example

Simple Spring Boot Admin example with a sba-server and sba-client.

The example is used to find out if it is possible to get Spring Boot Admin 3, Spring Boot 3 and Jolokia 2 to work together so that actuator endpoints are made available via JMX, and it is possible to trigger them via SBA.
